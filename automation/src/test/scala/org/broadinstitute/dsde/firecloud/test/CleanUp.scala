    * Function for controlling when the clean-up functions will be run.
    * Clean-up functions are usually run at the end of the test, which includes
    * clean-up from loan-fixture methods. This can cause problems if there are
    * dependencies, such as foreign key references, between test data created
    * in a loan-fixture method and the test itself:
    *
    * <pre>
    * "tries to clean-up parent before child" in {
    *   withParent { parent =>  // withParent loan-fixture clean-up will run before registered clean-up functions
    *     child = Child(parent)
    *     register cleanUp { delete child }
    *     ...
    *   }
    * }
    * </pre>
    *
    * Use withCleanUp to explicitly control when the registered clean-up
    * methods will be called:
    *
    * <pre>
    * "clean-up child before parent" in {
    *   withParent { parent =>
    *     withCleanUp {  // registered clean-up functions will run before enclosing loan-fixture clean-up
    *       child = Child(parent)
    *       register cleanUp { delete child }
    *       ...
    *     }
    *   }
    * }
    * </pre>
    *
    * Note that this is not needed if the dependent objects are contributed by
    * separate loan-fixture methods whose execution order can be explicitly
    * controlled:
    *
    * <pre>
    * "clean-up inner loan-fixtures first" in {
    *   withParent { parent =>
    *     withChild(parent) { child =>
    *       ...
    *     }
    *   }
    * }
    *
    * @param testCode the test code to run
